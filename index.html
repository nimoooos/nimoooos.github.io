                    provide Soldiers with a physical makerspace and digital platforms for creative design and collaboration aimed at
                    problems identified by Soldiers in their individual mission sets and capability gaps identified by command.
                    Lightning Labs also provides consolidated and ongoing support via access to small grants, patent agents, workshops,
                    and connections to 25ID senior leaders and academic partners. As the Army's primary innovation hub for jungle and nearshore warfare, Lightning Labs
                    fosters innovation at all echelons, from the lowest level of command and higher, ensuring our division's readiness for the challenges of tomorrow's
                    USINDOPACOM theater. <b style="font-size: large;">We believe that great ideas can come from anyone, anywhere, irrespective of rank or position.</b>
